Mohamed: To develop a highly responsive, intuitive user interface, and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
Technologies Used
Backend:

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used for building the backend APIs.
SQLAlchemy: An ORM for managing database interactions within Flask.
Jinja2: Flask's templating engine for dynamically rendering HTML pages.
Database:

MySQL: A relational database used to store all data, including user information, products, orders, and categories.
Redis: Used for caching and session management to improve performance.
Frontend:

HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
Bootstrap: A responsive framework to ensure the website looks good on all devices.
JavaScript: For client-side interactivity and AJAX requests.
Version Control:

Git: For tracking changes and managing source code.
GitHub: For collaboration and project management, including issue tracking and code reviews.
Third-Party Services:

Stripe: Considering integration for secure payment processing.
AWS S3: Potentially used for storing user-uploaded images, such as product photos.
Key Features
Product Catalog: Categorized listings of available grocery products with details such as price, description, and images.
Shopping Cart: A dynamic cart where users can add, remove, or update items before checkout.
Coupons & Discounts: Functionality to apply coupons and view discounted prices in real-time.
Order Tracking: Users can track the status of their orders from processing to delivery.
